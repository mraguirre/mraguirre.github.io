			<h2>Mission</h2>
			
			<p>At SGMS we make every effort to inspire students to make the dream of COLLEGE and CAREER READINESS a reality. We promote programs which help students achieve those goals. Most recently SGMS has added a Computer Science course. This course will guide students through fundamental  technical concepts (i.e. programming concepts, encryption, algorithmic thinking, etc...) which are becoming crucial tools for making sense of the modern world. Our focus on Mathematical development is student centered.</p>

			<h2>CS Discoveries</h2>
			<img class="feat-img" src="img/dvorak.png" alt="Dvorak Keyboard">
			<p>Computer Science Discoveries (CS Discoveries) 
			is an introductory computer science course that 
			empowers students to create authentic artifacts 
			and engage with computer science as a medium 
			for creativity, communication, problem solving, 
			and fun. </p>
			
			<h2>Mathematics</h2>
			<p>In grade 7, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1) developing understanding of and applying proportional 
			relationships; (2) developing understanding of operations with rational numbers and working with expressions and linear 
			equations; (3) solving problems involving scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and working with two- and 
			three-dimensional shapes to solve problems involving area, surface area, and volume; and (4) drawing inferences about  
			populations based on samples..</p>
