			<h2>Syllabus</h2>
			<p>Dear Students:</p>
			<p>Welcome to Computer Science at San Gorgonio Middle School.  My goal as your teacher is to guide you in exploring the study of information through interactive
				and student centered lessons. We will build websites, apps, and work with circuit boards in order to discover 
				computer science together. 
			</p> 
  			<p>I am looking forward to an exciting and rewarding year together! </p>

			<p>Sincerely,<br/>
			Mr. Aguirre<br/>
			Maths Teacher<br/></p>
