			<p>Computer Science is an introduction to the art of programming. This course will teach students to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. 
			Topics include:</p>

			<ol class="lists">
				<li>Algorithms</li>
				<li>Early forms of code(i.e. Morse, Braille, Machine Language etc...)</li>
				<li>Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Web Development(Scratch, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Java).</li>
				<li>Problem sets inspired by real-world domains(Maths, cryptography, and gaming)</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="caption">note: This course is an introduction and thus designed for students who have no prior experience with programming. This course will be taught using multiple online resources and IDE's(i.e. Scratch, KhanAcademy, Cloud9, etc...).</p>
